# Environmental 3D Artist (3D Generalist)

## Role Description

Environmental 3D Artists create the props, architecture, terrain, and scene dressing that make up game worlds. They build assets that are visually appealing, optimized for real-time performance, and usable in gameplay environments with lighting and mood.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Game-ready environment assets** (props, architecture, and set dressing built for real-time use)
> -   **High-quality hero props** (at least one piece showing strong silhouette, detail, and materials)  
> -   **Modular environment kits** (walls/floors/trim pieces designed for reuse and grid snapping)  
> -   **UVs + baking + PBR texturing** (UV layouts, bake proof, and texture maps where applicable)  
> -   **Material and shader work** (surface variety like metal/wood/stone/fabric, shown in real-time rendering)  
> -   **Lighting + mood scenes** (at least one environment composition demonstrating atmosphere and storytelling)  
> -   **Optimization proof** (triangle counts, texture budgets, and efficiency choices clearly documented)  
> -   **Gameplay-context usage** showing the environment or assets viewed from a player-style camera
> -   **Blockouts / planning breakdowns** (only if you created the layout or level structure)
>    
    

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each environment piece in your portfolio should be presented as a **complete game-ready asset or scene**, the way it would be reviewed in a professional environment art portfolio.

Use this checklist to organize your portfolio page (or ArtStation post). **The goal is not to do every category for every piece**, but to clearly show what work you personally completed.
-   Items labeled **Required** must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   Items under **Add-On Deliverables** should only be included if you personally completed that part of the pipeline (blockout, sculpting, shaders, lighting, level assembly, etc.).
-   If you collaborated with someone, clearly label what you did vs. what someone else did.
-   If you used someone else’s concept art, you may include it for reference, but you must credit the original artist.

- [ ] **Clay Turntable:** Animated 360° rotation around the object.  
- [ ] 🌟 **Gameplay Footage:** Video showing the object used in a game context.

### B) Required Written Info
- [ ] **Description:**  1–2 Sentence describing what it is and what it’s for in a game
- [ ] **Asset Type Label:** Prop / Modular Kit / Scene / Terrain
- [ ] **Style Tag:** Realistic/stylized / semi-real.  
- [ ] **Polycount + Texture Budget:** Tris + texture sizes listed clearly.  
- [ ] **Software List:** Tools used (ZBrush, Blender/Maya, Substance, Unity/Unreal, etc.).

### C) Modeling + Topology Proof 
- [ ] **Low-Poly Mesh:** Optimized character model suitable for real-time rendering.
- [ ] **Scale Proof:** Shown next to a character, mannequin, or scale reference
- [ ] **Wireframe Renders:** Full object + close up details (if applicable).
- [ ] **LOD Proof:** Side-by-side image showing LOD0 / LOD1 / LOD2 with triangle counts listed.

- [ ] **Real-Time Budget Target:** Platform target stated (PC/console/mobile) with triangle budget.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Common Triangle Budgets by Platform / Character Type:
> 
> | Platform / Use              | Typical Tris (LOD0 / Hero) |
> | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
> | Mobile / Low                | 5k–20k                     |
> | Switch / Indie              | 15k–40k                    |
> | PC / Console                | 40k–90k                    |
> | Hero / Cinematic PC/Console | 70k–120k                   |

## Add-On Deliverables

### Environment Scene + Storytelling (Required for Kits + Scenes)
- [ ] **Environmental Staging**: Rendered scene demonstrating the objects in a fully staged environment
- [ ] **Modular Assembly:** Image demonstrating how modular pieces come together in the environment scene.
- [ ] **Real-Time Flythrough Video:** Short fly-through or orbit showing the environment from multiple angles.
- [ ] **Environmental Story Intent (1–2 Sentences):** A 1-2 sentence description of what story the scene is meant to convey through props, lighting, and staging (no dialogue, no characters required).
