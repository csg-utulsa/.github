# Environmental 3D Artist (3D Generalist)

## Role Description

Environmental 3D Artists create the props, architecture, terrain, and scene dressing that make up game worlds. They build assets that are visually appealing, optimized for real-time performance, and usable in gameplay environments with lighting and mood.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Game-ready environment assets** (props, architecture, and set dressing built for real-time use)
> -   **High-quality hero props** (at least one piece showing strong silhouette, detail, and materials)  
> -   **Modular environment kits** (walls/floors/trim pieces designed for reuse and grid snapping)  
> -   **UVs + texturing** (maps, UV layout, and texture breakdowns where applicable)
> -   **Material and shader work** (surface variety like metal/wood/stone/fabric, shown in real-time rendering)  
> -   **Lighting + mood scenes** (at least one environment composition demonstrating atmosphere and storytelling)  
> -   **Optimization proof** (triangle counts, texture budgets, and efficiency choices clearly documented)  
> -   **Gameplay-context usage** showing the environment or assets viewed from a player-style camera
> -   **Blockouts / planning breakdowns** (only if you created the layout or level structure)
>    
    

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each environment piece in your portfolio should be presented as a **complete game-ready asset or scene**, the way it would be reviewed in a professional environment art portfolio.

Use this checklist to organize your portfolio page (or ArtStation post). **The goal is not to do every category for every piece**, but to clearly show what work you personally completed.
-   Items labeled **Required** must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   Items under **Add-On Deliverables** should only be included if you personally completed that part of the pipeline (blockout, sculpting, shaders, lighting, level assembly, etc.).
-   If you collaborated with someone, clearly label what you did vs. what someone else did.
-   If you used someone else’s concept art, you may include it for reference, but you must credit the original artist.

> [!NOTE]
> ### Common Triangle Budgets by Platform / Asset Type:
> 
> | Platform / Use              | Typical Tris (LOD0 / Hero) |
> | --------------------------- | -------------------------- |

> | Switch / Indie              | 500 - 2k                   |
> | PC / Console                | 2K – 10K                  |
> | Cinematic                   | 10k – 50K                   |
>

### D) Environment Storytelling
- [ ] **Environmental Staging**: Rendered scene demonstrating the objects in a fully staged environment

- [ ] 🌟 **Real-Time Gameplay Capture Flythrough:** Short fly-through or orbit showing the environment from multiple angles.
- [ ] **Environmental Story Intent (1–2 Sentences):** A 1-2 sentence description of what story the scene is meant to convey through props, lighting, and staging (no dialogue, no characters required).
