# Environmental 3D Artist (3D Generalist)

## Role Description

Environmental 3D Artists create the props, architecture, terrain, and scene dressing that make up game worlds. They build assets that are visually appealing, optimized for real-time performance, and usable in gameplay environments with lighting and mood.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Game-ready environment assets** (props, architecture, and set dressing built for real-time use)
> -   **High-quality hero props** (at least one piece showing strong silhouette, detail, and materials)  
> -   **Modular environment kits** (walls/floors/trim pieces designed for reuse and grid snapping)  
> -   **UVs + baking + PBR texturing** (UV layouts, bake proof, and texture maps where applicable)  
> -   **Material and shader work** (surface variety like metal/wood/stone/fabric, shown in real-time rendering)  
> -   **Lighting + mood scenes** (at least one environment composition demonstrating atmosphere and storytelling)  
> -   **Optimization proof** (triangle counts, texture budgets, and efficiency choices clearly documented)  
> -   **Gameplay-context usage** showing the environment or assets viewed from a player-style camera
> -   **Blockouts / planning breakdowns** (only if you created the layout or level structure)
>    
    

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each environment piece in your portfolio should be presented as a **complete game-ready asset or scene**, the way it would be reviewed in a professional environment art portfolio.

Use this checklist to organize your portfolio page (or ArtStation post). **The goal is not to do every category for every piece**, but to clearly show what work you personally completed.
-   Items labeled **Required** must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   Items under **Add-On Deliverables** should only be included if you personally completed that part of the pipeline (blockout, sculpting, shaders, lighting, level assembly, etc.).
-   If you collaborated with someone, clearly label what you did vs. what someone else did.
-   If you used someone else’s concept art, you may include it for reference, but you must credit the original artist.
