# UX Designer
UX Designers bridge the gap between **complex game systems and the player’s understanding**, designing the “conversation” between player and game. Their work ensures that **mechanics are intuitive, information is accessible, and players never feel lost** in menus or systems.

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> 
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
>
> -   **Wireframes & Interactive Prototypes:** Low- or mid-fidelity layouts showing logic, hierarchy, and flow.
> -   **Player Journey & Flow Maps:** Diagrams showing how players move through menus or interact with systems.
> -   **Information Architecture:** How menus, screens, and data are structured for clarity.
> -   **Usability & Testing Evidence:** Proof of identifying problems and iterating based on real data.
> -   **Accessibility Features:** Colorblind modes, scalable UI, alternative inputs, or visual/audio cues.

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist
Each portfolio piece should clearly show **your ability to create 2D assets that are readable, consistent, and functional in a game context**. Use this checklist to structure your submission.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include only if you personally created them (user testing, HUD/Diegetic design, accessibility systems, etc.).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts you were responsible for.

# 

## Required Deliverables

- [ ] **User Flow Diagram:** Visual map of player navigation through the system.
- [ ] 🌟 **Real-Time Interaction Capture:** Short clip showing navigation, selection, feedback states, and transitions.

### B) Required Written Info
- [ ] **System Name + Description (1–2 sentences):** What system you designed (inventory, HUD, onboarding (tutorial), skill tree, etc.).
- [ ] **Player Problem Statement:** What usability issue or player need were you addressing?
- [ ] **Design Intent:** What the player should feel or understand while interacting with the system.
