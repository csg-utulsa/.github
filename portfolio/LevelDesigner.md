## Level Designer
Level designers create playable environments that guide players, communicate narrative, and stage interactions through layout, props, and lighting. Their work balances pacing and challenge while ensuring the space naturally suggests what players can do, how they move, and how they engage with the world, all without explicit instructions.

> [!IMPORTANT\]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Block Mesh Levels** (playable layouts showing scale, flow, and pacing)
> -   **Level Flow & Pacing Diagrams** (charts showing encounters, intensity curves, and progression)
> -  **Spatial Storytelling Proof** (annotations, screenshots, or videos showing narrative conveyed through environment)
> - **Interactive Level Prototypes** (playable examples with scripted events, doors, or dynamic elements)
> - **Navigation & Landmarking** (sightlines, color cues, landmarks to guide player movement)
> - **Gameplay Footage / Walkthroughs** showing the level in action
> - **Environmental Storytelling** (small scenes showing narrative through props, lighting, and layout)


# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist (Per evel Design Piece)

Each level or level section in your portfolio should show **your ability to design, guide, and stage gameplay spaces**, with supporting documentation. Use this checklist to structure your submission.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every level piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include only if you personally created them (concept sketches, scripting, pacing charts, etc.).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts you were responsible for.

# 

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ] **Level Overview Screenshot / Video:** High-resolution image or short video showing the full layout.
- [ ] **Playable Blockout / Greybox:** Demonstrates scale, player flow, and spatial readability.
- [ ] **Multiple Angles / Section Views:** 3–5 shots highlighting key areas, choke points, or landmarks.
- [ ] 🌟**Gameplay Footage / Walkthrough:** Short recording showing traversal, navigation, and core gameplay pacing.

### B) Required Written Info
- [ ] **Level Name + 1–2 Sentence Description:** Purpose of the level and intended player experience.
- [ ] **Story & Gameplay Intent (1–2 Sentences):** What the player should feel or discover, and how gameplay mechanics support the narrative.
- [ ] **Target Platform / Genre:** Indicate where the level would be used (PC, console, VR, mobile).
- [ ] **Player Capacity / Scale Notes:** Map dimensions, expected number of players (if multiplayer), or approximate traversal times.
- [ ] **Software Used:** Tools (Blender, Unreal, Unity, World Machine, etc.).
    
### C) Interactive / Dynamic Elements 
- [ ] 🌟**Playable Prototype:** Show scripted events, interactive doors, destructible objects, or elevators.
- [ ]  **Annotations of Interactivity:** Explain what triggers gameplay events and why they improve flow.
- [ ] **Technical Notes:** Basic explanation of scripting approach or logic if implemented.

### D) Storytelling Through Level Design (Player Experience Focus)
- [ ] **Interaction Narrative Clips / Screenshots:** Short gameplay clips or annotated screenshots highlighting **affordances** (doors, climbable surfaces, cover, puzzles, destructibles) that convey story or guide player discovery.
- [ ] **Environmental Story Callouts:** Notes or labels pointing to objects, props, or layout elements and explaining **how they reinforce narrative or world-building**.
- [ ] **Visual Focus Proof:** Evidence that geometry, lighting, and focal points lead the player’s attention to key narrative interactions (not just decorative elements).

## Add-On Deliverables

### E) Level Flow & Pacing 
- [ ] **Flow Diagram / Map:** Annotated layout showing paths, loops, shortcuts, and branching.
- [ ] **Encounter / Challenge Charts:** Pacing curve charting difficulty spikes, combat areas, puzzles, or scripted events.
- [ ] **Player Guidance Proof:** Evidence of visual or spatial cues (landmarks, color coding, sightlines).

### F) Level Optimization / Playability
- [ ]  **Performance Proof Screenshot:** Wireframe + triangle count + material count shown.
- [ ]  **Traversal Readability Screenshot:** Annotated image with arrows showing the intended player path + labels for climb/jump/cover areas.
- [ ]  **Navigation Proof Screenshot:** Annotated image showing landmarks + major sightlines that guide the player.
- [ ]  🌟 **Readability Walkthrough Clip:** 10–30 second gameplay capture showing navigation and traversal working in motion.
    

### G) Case Study / Breakdown
- [ ] **Before / After Screenshots or Blockout-to-Final Comparison:** Show evolution from greybox to final art (if applicable).
- [ ] **Step-by-Step Explanation:** Brief notes on design decisions, player testing feedback, and iteration.
