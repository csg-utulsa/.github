# Game Designer
Game Designers are the **architects of player experience**, defining “fun” through **mechanics, rules, and system interactions**. Their work ensures a game is **playable, engaging, balanced, and rewarding**, from the first minute to the last. Unlike artists, designers must make **abstract systems and experiences visible** through documentation, diagrams, prototypes, and playtest evidence.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
>
> -   **Game Design Documents (GDDs / One-Pagers):** Clearly describe vision, systems, and mechanics.
> -   **System & Mechanics Breakdowns:** How features interact and affect player experience.
> -   **Gameplay Loops & Core Loops:** Visualizations of action, reward, and feedback cycles.
> -   **Balance & Economy Data:** Spreadsheets or charts showing stats, probability, and progression.
> -   **Iterative Design Evidence:** Notes and changes based on playtesting or player data.
> -   **Playable Demos or Gameplay Footage:** Demonstrate how mechanics function in practice.

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist
Each portfolio piece should **demonstrate your ability to design, refine, and balance systems and player experiences**, supported by documentation, diagrams, and playable examples.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include if you personally contributed (balance analysis, pacing charts, iteration logs, etc.).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts you were responsible for.

# 

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ] **High-Concept / One-Pager:** Concise summary of the game’s hook, target audience, and unique selling points.
- [ ] **🌟 Real-Time Gameplay Capture:** 30–90 second video highlighting core mechanics, loops, and interactions, optionally with commentary or overlays explaining design intent.
- [ ] **🌟 Real-Time Puzzle/Quest in Game:** include a real-time gameplay clip showing the puzzle/quest in action.
- [ ] **Core Gameplay Loop Diagram:** Visual representation of Action → Reward → Upgrade or progression cycles.
- [ ] **Feature Breakdown:** Deep dive into a single mechanic (e.g., “Dialogue Reputation System” or “Grappling Hook Physics”).


### B) Written Documentation
- [ ] **Player Experience Goals:** What player behavior, feeling, or engagement are you trying to evoke?
- [ ] **Problem & Solution:** Example of a mechanic or system that required iteration to solve a design problem.
- [ ] **Role & Scope:** Define whether you were a Systems Designer, Combat Designer, Economy Designer, etc.
- [ ] **Software / Tools Used:** Unity, Unreal, Excel/Google Sheets, Miro, Machinations, Jira, or prototyping tools.
- [ ] **Case Study / Iteration Narrative:** Step-by-step account of prototyping, testing, and final design.
- [ ] **References / Inspirations:** Credit mechanics, systems, or frameworks that inspired your design.

### C) Technical Design & Logic
- [ ] **System Interaction Map:** Diagram showing how subsystems interact (e.g., Combat → Inventory → Economy).
- [ ] **Mechanic Flowchart:** Logic of a specific mechanic handling player input and edge cases.
- [ ] **UX Writing / Player Feedback Examples:** UI prompts, tutorials, or “juice” that communicate mechanics clearly.
- [ ] **Technical Design & Logic:** diagram the puzzle logic, triggers, or quest progression.

## Add-On Deliverables
### D) Systems & Balance (The Math Side)
- [ ] **Balance Spreadsheet:** Enemy stats, XP curves, weapon stats, or probability tables.
- [ ] **Probability & Economy Charts:** Drop rates, progression curves, or TTK (time-to-kill) metrics.
- [ ] **Live-Ops / Retention Plan (Optional):** How the game stays engaging over time (daily quests, battle passes).
    
### E) Mission & Encounter Design (The Pacing Side)
- [ ] **Top-Down Mission Map:** 2D layout showing encounter beats, safe zones, objectives, and player flow.
- [ ] **Beat Sheet / Pacing Curve:** Graph of intensity or engagement throughout the level/mission.
- [ ] **Objective Logic / Triggers:** Notes on how game events are triggered by player actions.
    
### F) Player Research & Playtesting
- [ ]  **Player Personas:** Target player profiles with motivations, playstyles, and behaviors.
- [ ] **Playtest Data Visualization:** Feedback summaries, heatmaps, or survey results.
- [ ]  **Actionable Changes:** Documented design decisions made in response to playtesting.

### G) Documentation Quality (Professional Standards)
- [ ] **Formatting & Readability:** Clear GDDs with headings, bullet points, and easy navigation.
- [ ] **Version Control / Changelog:** History of document evolution throughout development.
