# Programmer – Game Systems

Game systems programmers focus on building robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture. This includes AI, physics, UI systems, networking, multiplayer functionality, performance optimization, and custom tool or engine development. Their work ensures the game runs smoothly, systems are maintainable, and gameplay features integrate reliably with the underlying architecture.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> - **Modular & Extensible Systems** (inventory, quest systems, ability frameworks, save/load)
> - **Architectural Design Patterns** (Factories, Observers, Strategy)
> - **AI & Decision Logic** (Behavior Trees, GOAP, Utility AI, pathfinding optimization)
> - **Data-Driven Design** (JSON, ScriptableObjects, Databases to drive content)
> - **Performance & Profiling** (CPU/GPU optimization, memory management, multi-threading)
> - **Networking & Persistence** (state synchronization, multiplayer prototypes, serialization)
> - **Integration Examples** (working with art, audio, UI, and gameplay features)
> - **Clean, SOLID, Documented Code** (production-ready, properly commented, readable, and maintainable)

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist
Each portfolio piece should demonstrate your ability to **design, implement, and optimize complex systems** that integrate with other teams while maintaining clarity, performance, and scalability.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every system portfolio piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include only if you personally created them (AI, physics, networking, tools, etc.).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts were your responsibility.

# 

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation & Architecture Visualization
- [ ]  🌟 **Real-Time Gameplay Footage:** A short clip showing the system working in-game context.
- [ ] **System Architecture Diagram:** High-level flowchart or UML diagram showing component interaction (e.g., InventoryManager ↔ UI ↔ SaveSystem).
- [ ] **Technical Walkthrough Video:** Screen capture explaining the system’s logic, showing how data flows from input/trigger to output.
- [ ]  **Stress Test / Benchmark Video:** Clip showing system handling extreme conditions (e.g., 500 AI agents, 1,000 items) with visible frame-rate counter.
- [ ]  🌟 **In-Engine Screenshot:** demonstrating usage of the system setup/integration within the game in-engine (e.g., adding a new item without code).
    
### B) Required Written Info
- [ ]  **System Name + 1–2 Sentence Summary:** What the system does and why.
- [ ] **Technical Constraints / Goals:** Challenges or problems addressed (e.g., handling 100+ synced objects over high-latency network).
- [ ] **Design Pattern Rationale:** Why specific architectural patterns were chosen (e.g., Command, Observer, Factory).
- [ ] **Software & Language:** Unity/C#, Unreal/C++, Godot/GDScript, etc.
- [ ] **Your Contribution (Collaboration Note):** What you built vs. what was provided.
- [ ] **Cite External Assets & Libraries:** List any external code, plugins, assets, tutorials, or samples used and note the license/source for each.
- [ ] **Case Study / Breakdown:** Step-by-step explanation of problem-solving, iteration, and refinement processes. Highlight challenges and solutions. (Minimum - one portfolio piece)
    

### C) Code & Implementation
- [ ] 🌟 **GitHub Repository Link:** Link to the project repo (or the specific folder containing the system).
- [ ] **Core Architecture Scripts:** Base classes, Interfaces or managers forming the system core.
- [ ] **Code Snippet Gallery:** 2–5 screenshots showing the “meat” of the logic (state transitions, math, detection logic, etc.).
- [ ] **Data-Driven Proof:** Demonstrate system reading/writing data (JSON, ScriptableObjects, Databases).
- [ ] **Tuning Variables Exposed:** Show adjustable values (speed, damage, cooldown, range, gravity, etc.).
- [ ] **Feedback Hooks:** short clip demonstrating triggered feedback in action (animation, VFX, SFX, UI, camera behavior, hit pause, etc.).
- [ ] **Profiling / Performance Report:** Screenshot or report showing CPU/memory optimization, multithreading, or reduced GC.
- [ ] **Optimization Note (1–2 Sentences):** How you kept it efficient (pooling, reduced allocations, cached lookups, fewer Update calls, etc.).
- [ ] **README File:** Clear setup instructions for integrating, testing, or running the system.


> \[!NOTE\]  
> All code should follow **professional coding standards**: clear naming conventions, DRY, consistent formatting/style rules, clean organization, robust error handling (null checks, try/catch), and documentation comments (XML or inline where applicable).

## Add-On Deliverables

### D) AI & Physics Systems
- [ ] **AI Logic Visualization:** Screenshot/video of Behavior Tree, FSM, or Utility AI graph.
- [ ] **Physics / Math Proof:** Custom raycasting, collision, or mathematical calculations (trajectory, force application, etc.).
    
### E) Tools & Workflow Optimization
- [ ] **In-Engine Debugging:** screenshot of gizmos and debugging visuals (e.g., hitboxes, rays, detection volumes, state display, etc.)
- [ ] **Custom Editor Tools:** screenshots and code snippets of in-editor tools for designers (e.g., item creator, procedural generator).
- [ ] **Documentation for Non-Programmers:** User manual or README for integrating the system without coding.
        
### F) Networking & Multiplayer
- [ ] **Multiplayer Sync Proof:** Video showing multiple instances staying in sync during complex interactions.
- [ ] **Optimization Before/After:** Case study showing system refactoring (Garbage Collection reduction, draw call reduction, improved memory usage).
    
### G) Collaboration & Integration
