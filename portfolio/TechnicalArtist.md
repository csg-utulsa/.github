## Technical Artist
Technical Artists are the **bridge between art and engineering**. They don’t primarily create final assets or design levels; instead, they **solve technical challenges, optimize workflows, and enable artists and designers to realize their vision efficiently**.

> [!IMPORTANT\]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Optimization & Performance Solutions:** Reducing draw calls, memory usage, or improving frame rates.  
> -   **Shader & Material Implementation:** Custom shaders or materials that enhance visuals efficiently.
> -   **Lighting & Rendering Setup:** Real-time and baked lighting, URP/HDRP configurations, scalable settings.
> -   **Tool & Pipeline Development:** Scripts, editor extensions, or workflows that speed up or automate tasks.
> -   **Procedural & VFX Systems:** Particle systems, procedural content, or gameplay-reactive effects.
> -   **Integration Proof:** Demonstrating how your solutions fit into the engine pipeline and support art/design teams.


# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each level or level section in your portfolio should show **your ability to design, guide, and stage gameplay spaces**, with supporting documentation. Use this checklist to structure your submission.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Specific deep-dives based on your sub-specialty (Tools, Shaders, Rigging, or VFX).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts you were responsible for.

# 

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ] **Hero Shot / Demo Clip:** Short video or high-quality render showing the technical solution in context (e.g., shader, optimized environment, VFX).
- [ ] **Real-Time Scene / Gameplay Capture:** Demonstrates your solution in action (lighting, shaders, procedural systems, or VFX).
- [ ] **Technical Deep Dive:** Narrated video or annotated screenshots explaining the problem, your approach, and the technical logic.
- [ ]  **Visual Logic Display:** Screenshots of Shader Graphs, Blueprints, HLSL snippets, or editor scripts with clear annotations.
- [ ] **Tool UI Demonstration:** If you created tools or pipelines, show the interface and how it helps artists/designers.

#### B) Written Documentation
- [ ] **Problem Statement:** What technical challenge or bottleneck were you addressing (e.g., high draw calls, inefficient lighting, slow workflow)?
- [ ] **Solution Overview:** 2–3 sentence summary of your approach and reasoning.
- [ ] **Software & Engine Used:** Unity (URP/HDRP, VFX Graph, Shader Graph), Unreal, Blender, Maya, C#, C++, Python, etc.
- [ ] **Performance Impact / Metrics:** Concrete evidence of improvement (frame rate gains, memory reduction, time saved for artists).
- [ ] **Cite External Assets:** Include all external assets (e.g., images, textures, models, sounds, references) used in your work, and note the license, permission, or source for each.

#### C) Logic, Modularity & Optimization
- [ ] **Algorithm / Technical Explanation:** Brief notes on math, procedural logic, or systems used (e.g., Voronoi for procedural textures, LOD logic).
- [ ] **Modularity / Reusability Proof:** Show how your solution can be reused across different scenes, projects, or by other team members.
- [ ] **Performance Evidence:** Profiler screenshots, frame debugger outputs, or GPU visualizations showing efficiency.

## Add-On Deliverables

#### D) Shaders & Materials
- [ ] **Parameter Demo:** Clips showing real-time adjustment of variables (e.g., water ripple intensity, moss coverage).
- [ ] **Texture Optimization:** Examples of channel packing or memory-efficient workflows.
    
#### E) Rigging & Animation Tech
- [ ] **Stress / Deformation Tests:** Show rigs pushed to extreme poses to validate technical setup.
- [ ] **Automation Comparison:** Demonstrate time saved using scripts or tools vs. manual workflows.
- [ ] **Control Rig / Gizmo UI:** Screenshots or clips of custom animator controls.
  
#### F) Environment & Lighting Tech
- [ ] **Lighting Scalability:** Demonstrate quality and performance across low-to-high settings.
- [ ] **Procedural / VFX Systems:** Show how procedural or particle systems respond to gameplay or scene changes.
- [ ] **Integration Proof:** Highlight how your solution fits into the engine pipeline and supports art/design.
    
#### G) Case Study / Iteration Loop
- [ ] **Failures & Pivots:** Document a technical approach that didn’t work and how you iterated to the final solution.
- [ ] **Pipeline Integration Notes:** Show how your solution interacts with assets, lighting, and gameplay systems.
