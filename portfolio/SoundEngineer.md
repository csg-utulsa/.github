# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each portfolio piece should show your ability to create, implement, and integrate high-quality audio in a game context.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include only if you personally created them (adaptive audio logic, foley recording, dialogue editing, etc.).
-   **Collaboration Note:** Clearly indicate which parts of the audio pipeline were your work.

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ] **Final Mix Reel / Audio Showcase:** 30–90 second clip demonstrating SFX, foley, and environmental audio.
- [ ] **Music Playlist** 30-second highlight reel of musical compositions.
- [ ] 🌟 **Interactive Audio Demo Clip:** Short gameplay clip showing individual sounds responding to player actions or environmental events (isolated from the full mix if possible).
- [ ] 🌟 **Real-Time Gameplay Capture:** Video demonstrating full audio integration (i.e., multiple layers of audio) interacting dynamically in-game context.
    
### B) Required Written Info
- [ ] **Asset Name + Description (1–2 sentences):** What the audio asset is and its intended purpose in the game.
- [ ]  **Game / Scene Context:** Where and how the audio is used in gameplay.
- [ ] **Tools / Middleware Used:** DAW (Pro Tools, Reaper, Ableton), Wwise, FMOD, Unity, Unreal, etc.
- [ ] **Cite External Assets:** Credit any external sounds, samples, or recordings used and note licenses or permissions.
- [ ] **Full Game Asset List Spreadsheet:** Provide a spreadsheet listing **all audio assets in the game** with the following columns:
        -   **Asset Name** – name of the file/asset
        -   **Type** – Music, SFX, Ambience, Dialogue, UI sound, etc.
        -   **Scene / Context** – where or when it’s used in the game
        -   **Creator** – in-house or external
        -   **Length / Duration** – in seconds or minutes
        -   **Format / Sample Rate** – file type and sample rate
        -   **External Source / License** – credit third-party or licensed assets
        -   **Notes / Usage Details** – any additional info like loops, triggers, or variations
    
### C) Sound Asset Deliverables
- [ ] **Sound Effects / Foley Files:** Raw recordings and edited clips showing clean audio ready for integration.
- [ ] **Environmental Audio / Ambience:** Looping or layered environmental clips demonstrating space, depth, and immersion.
- [ ]  **Original Music / Composition:** Clips of composed tracks or themes intended for gameplay, cutscenes, or UI. Include notation, DAW session, or MIDI where applicable.
- [ ] **Adaptive / Dynamic Music:** Clips or demonstrations of music reacting to game events or player choices.
- [ ] **Mix & Master Proof:** Screenshot or session file showing levels, panning, EQ, and effects used in the final mix.
    
### D) Implementation Deliverables
- [ ]  **Adaptive Audio Flow Diagram:** Visual showing how music and sound states change in response to game events.
- [ ] **Middleware Setup / Event Mapping:** Screenshots or short video showing Wwise/FMOD events, Real-time Parameter Controls (RTPCs), or state logic.
- [ ] **Spatial / Positional Audio Proof:** Demonstration of 3D audio positioning, distance attenuation, and listener-relative effects.
