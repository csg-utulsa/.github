# 3D Environmental Artist (3D Generalist)

## Role Description

Narrative Designers **bridge story and gameplay**. They design the **structures, branching logic, and systems** that allow players to experience a story through action, choice, and consequence. Unlike game writers, they focus on **how narrative is delivered interactively**, including non-linear paths, quest integration, and systemic storytelling.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Branching Narrative Architecture:** Flowcharts showing choices, consequences, and state-tracking.
> -   **Interactive Dialogue Samples:** Scripts formatted for engines, showing variables, conditions, and branching paths.
> -   **Quest / Mission Integration:** Documentation showing how narrative beats trigger gameplay objectives.
> -   **Environmental Storytelling:** Narrative delivery through props, audio logs, or world-building.
> -   **Narrative Systems Design:** How systems like reputation, morality, or relationships influence story.
> -   **Real-Time Demonstrations:** Videos or interactive demos showing narrative sequences in action.

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist

Each portfolio piece should show **your ability to design interactive, branching, and system-integrated narratives**, supported by scripts, diagrams, and real-time demonstrations.

Use this checklist to organize your portfolio page (or ArtStation post). **The goal is not to do every category for every piece**, but to clearly show what work you personally completed.
-   Items labeled **Required** must be included for every portfolio piece.
-   Items under **Add-On Deliverables** include if you personally created (voice/tone guides, cinematic scripts, environmental storytelling).
-   If you used someone else’s concept art, you may include it for reference, but you must credit the original artist.

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ] **Story Flowchart / Global Branching Map:** Visual diagram of key plot beats, major choice nodes, and branch convergence.
- [ ] **Interactive Script Sample:** 3–5 pages of dialogue showing branching paths with conditional logic (e.g., IF {Reputation > 10}, IF {Met\_Character\_X}).
- [ ] **Mission / Quest Design Document:** Breakdown showing “Golden Path” vs. critical player paths, with story-beat triggers and gameplay integration.
- [ ] 🌟 **Playable Narrative Prototype / Video:** Real-time demo or engine sequence showing branching story, dialogue, or quest mechanics in action.

## B) Written Documentation
- [ ] **Narrative Pillar Statement:** Core story truth and how gameplay supports it (1–2 sentences).
- [ ] **Player Agency Breakdown:** What the player can influence and what remains fixed.
- [ ] **Software & Tools Used:** (Twine, Ink/Inky, Miro, Articy: draft, Unity, Unreal, Fungus).
- [ ]  **Case Study / Implementation Notes:** Problem encountered and technical or design solution applied.

## C) Character & World Building
- [ ] **Functional Character Profiles:** Motivations, narrative roles (Mentor, Foil, etc.), and branching dialogue variations.
- [ ] **Lore / World Bible Snippet:** Concise example of world-building directly affecting gameplay.

### D) Professional Quality Check
- [ ]  **Formatting Consistency:** Scripts and diagrams follow industry-standard formats.
- [ ]  **Clarity of Logic::** Flowcharts and scripts are readable and actionable by programmers or designers.

## Add-On Deliverables

### E) Non-Linear Design & Choice
- [ ]  **Consequence Matrix:** Table showing how choices in early acts affect outcomes later.
- [ ]  **State Tracking Documentation:** How the game tracks decisions (flags, variables, invisible counters).
- [ ]  **Dialogue Node Mapping:** Spreadsheet mapping dialogue nodes for implementation, showing **branching paths, conditional logic, and outcomes**.
- [ ]  **Dialogue System UX Notes:** Wireframes or annotations showing how choices are presented (text boxes, wheels, diegetic UI).
- [ ]  **Quest / Mission Tracker:** Spreadsheet linking story beats to gameplay objectives and triggers.

### F) Environmental & Systemic Storytelling
- [ ] **Voice & Tone Guide:** Rules for dialogue, narration, and linguistic consistency.
- [ ] **Environmental Narrative Callouts:** Screenshots annotated to show story via props, lighting, or object placement.
- [ ] **Systemic Narrative Design:** Description of non-scripted story systems (e.g., procedural NPC interactions, nemesis systems).
- [ ]  **Audio / Collectible Specs:** Placement logic for narrative items like audio logs, letters, or diaries.
    
### G) Cinematics & Story Staging
- [ ]  **Cinematic Script / Storyboard:** Script with camera cues, timing, and emotive direction.
- [ ]  **Pacing Diagram:** Graph of narrative tension and beats over time for scenes or missions.
