# 3D Character Modeler & Animator
3D Character Modelers & Animators create game-ready characters from concept to real-time implementation. 
This includes sculpting, retopology, UVs, texturing, rigging, animation, and demonstrating the character functioning in-engine with clean deformation and believable motion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> -   **Game-ready character models** (low-poly meshes built for real-time use)
> -   **High-poly sculpts** (for at least one character, showing detail and form)
> -   **Retopology + deformation-ready topology** (clean wireframes around joints and face loops)
> -   **UVs + baking + PBR texturing** (maps, UV layout, and texture breakdowns where applicable)
> -   **Material and shader work** (surface variety like skin/cloth/metal, shown in real-time rendering)
> -   **Rigged characters** (animation-ready control rigs and clean deformation tests)
> -   **Animation clips** (idle, walk, run, and an action animation; facial animation if applicable)
> -   **Gameplay usage footage** showing the character functioning in a game-style camera view
> -   **Concept art + turnaround sheets** (only if you created the concept)

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist
Each character in your portfolio should be presented as a **complete character package**, the way it would be reviewed in a professional portfolio.

Use this checklist to organize your character page (or ArtStation post). **The goal is not to do every possible category for every character**, but to clearly show what work you personally completed.
-   Items labeled **Required** must be included for every character.
-   Items under **Add-On Deliverables** should only be included if you personally completed that part of the pipeline (sculpting, concept art, rigging, animation, texturing, shaders, etc.).
-   If you collaborated with someone, clearly label what you did vs. what someone else did.
-   If you use someone else’s concept art, you may include it for reference, but you must credit the original artist.
