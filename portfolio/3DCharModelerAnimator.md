# 3D Character Modeler & Animator
3D Character Modelers & Animators create game-ready characters from concept to real-time implementation. 
This includes sculpting, retopology, UVs, texturing, rigging, animation, and demonstrating the character functioning in-engine with clean deformation and believable motion.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ### Portfolio Item Types (What Your Portfolio Should Contain)
> -   **High-poly and low-poly character models**
> -   **Retopology + deformation-ready topology examples**
> -   **Texturing and material/shader work (PBR)**
> -   **Rigged characters with animation-ready control systems**
> -   **Animation clips (idle, walk, run, action, facial if applicable)**
> -   **In-engine usage (Unity/Unreal) showing real-time readiness**
> -   **Concept art/turnarounds (optional but strongly recommended)**
>   
    

## Portfolio Deliverables Checklist (Per Character Piece)
