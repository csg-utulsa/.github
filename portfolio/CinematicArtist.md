## Cinematic Artist / Sequencer

Cinematic artists use **Unity Timeline** or **Unreal Sequencer** to choreograph **cameras, animation, lighting, VFX, and audio** into polished real-time cutscenes and scripted moments that support story, mood, and gameplay.

> \[!IMPORTANT\]
> 
> ### What Your Portfolio Should Contain
> 
> -   **Storyboards / Animatics** (planned shots + pacing before 3D)
> -   **Sequencer/Timeline Cinematics** (30–60 second in-engine sequences)
> -   **Camera Direction Proof** (shot composition, lens choices, camera movement)
> -   **Environmental Motion + VFX** (timed props, particles, lighting changes)
> -   **Gameplay-to-Cinematic Integration** (triggered sequences + transitions)
> -   **Audio + Timing Sync** (cuts, motion, and events aligned to sound/music)
> -   **Final Reel / Presentation Clips** (clean edited output with captions)
>     

# Portfolio Deliverables Checklist (Per Cinematic Piece)

Each cinematic sequence in your portfolio should demonstrate your ability to plan, direct, and implement real-time scenes, with clear evidence of timing, shot design, and technical sequencing.
-   **Required Deliverables:** Must be included for every cinematic piece.
-   **Add-On Deliverables:** Include only if you personally created them (audio, VFX, scripting, etc.).
-   If you collaborated, clearly indicate which parts you were responsible for.

# 

## Required Deliverables 

### A) Presentation
- [ ]  🌟 **Final Cinematic Clip:** 30–60 seconds rendered directly from in-game footage.
- [ ]  🌟 **Gameplay-to-Cinematic Clip:** Player control → cinematic → back to control.
- [ ]  **Cinematic Overview:** 1–2 shots or a short clip showing the full scene setup.
- [ ]  **Shot Variety Proof:** At least 3 distinct shots (wide / medium/close).
- [ ]  **Readable Captions:** Your role + tools used (Timeline/Sequencer, cameras, etc.).
    
### B) Required Written Info
- [ ]  **Sequence Title + 1–2 Sentence Intent:** What story beat or mood is being delivered?
- [ ]  **Engine + Tools Used:** Unity / Unreal + Sequencer/Timeline + any DCC tools.
- [ ]  **Length + Context:** Cutscene, intro, gameplay moment, or scripted event.
    
### C) Planning (Previs)
- [ ] **Beat Sheet:** One-page breakdown of the key sequence beats.
- [ ]  **Storyboard (6–12 Frames):** Key compositions and shot order.
- [ ]  **Animatic (Optional but Strong):** Timed storyboard video proving pacing.
    
### D) Sequencer / Timeline Proof
- [ ]  **Sequencer Screenshot:** Timeline view showing organized tracks (camera, animation, audio, FX).
- [ ]  **Camera Keyframe Proof:** Clear easing and intentional camera motion (not linear/robotic).
- [ ]  **Event Timing Proof:** Markers or triggers showing when key moments hit.

## Add-On Deliverables

### E) Cinematic Direction (Camera + Composition)
- [ ] **Composition Proof (Annotated Frame):** Export **1 still frame** from the cinematic with callouts showing **focal point**, **foreground/midground/background**, and **visual hierarchy** (optional thirds grid).
- [ ] **Lens / FOV Proof (Wide vs Tight):** Export **2 still frames** of the same shot from the same camera position:
      -   **Wide lens** (high FOV)
      -   **Tight lens** (low FOV)
      - Label each with the **FOV / focal length**.
- [ ] **Camera Settings Screenshot:** Screenshot of the **camera component settings** (FOV / focal length visible).
- [ ] **Camera Language Clip (10–20s):** A short clip showing **one intentional camera move** (push-in, reveal, handheld, orbit, etc.).
- [ ] **Camera Move Proof (Timeline Screenshot):** Screenshot of the **Sequencer/Timeline camera track** showing keyframes and easing.
- [ ] **Shot Intent (1 sentence):** One sentence explaining what the shot is trying to communicate emotionally.
    
### F) Environmental Motion + VFX
- [ ] **Secondary Motion:** Animated props timed to the sequence (doors, debris, cloth, etc.).
- [ ] **VFX Sync:** Particle effects triggered on timeline events (dust, sparks, rain, explosions).
- [ ] **Dynamic Lighting:** Lighting changes during the scene (flicker, alarms, sunset shift, etc.).

### G) Audio + Polish
- [ ]  **Audio Sync Proof:** Cuts or motion landing on a beat, sound effect, or dialogue moment.
- [ ]   **Post-Processing Proof:** Raw vs graded comparison (DOF, bloom, LUT, etc.).
- [ ]    🌟 **Final Mini-Reel (60–90s):** Compilation of your best shots with clean labels.
    
### H) Case Study / Breakdown
- [ ]  **Before / After:** Storyboard → previs → final sequence comparison.
- [ ]  **Iteration Notes:** 3–6 bullets explaining key improvements you made after testing.
